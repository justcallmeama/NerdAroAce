- 👋 Hi, I’m @justcallmeama
- 👀 I’m interested in Indie Videogames, the furry fandom and aviation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning aviation for getting a SPL sailplane license
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, i barely code at all
- 📫 How to reach me discord (username: justcallmeama )
- 😄 Pronouns: any
- ⚡ Fun fact: theres 3 squawk cheatcodes in aviation. 7500 to fly with F15s. 7600 to mute the annoying ATC and do whatever you want. 7700 to get priority landing anywhere.
